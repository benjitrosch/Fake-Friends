**Fake Friends**, a Jackbox.tv style party game where you can separate your real friends from your fake ones!

One player creates a survey, and sends a link to their friends. Then, they all join a room together and compete to see who knows their friend best!

# **How to play**

- **Make a new survey**: one player will create a 5 question survey of yes or no questions.
